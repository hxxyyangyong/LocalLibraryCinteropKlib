        severity="Warning"
        message="Lint found an issue registry (`androidx.annotation.experimental.lint.ExperimentalIssueRegistry`) which did not specify the Lint API version it was compiled with.&#xA;&#xA;**This means that the lint checks are likely not compatible.**&#xA;&#xA;If you are the author of this lint check, make your lint `IssueRegistry` class contain&#xA;  override val api: Int = com.android.tools.lint.detector.api.CURRENT_API&#xA;or from Java,&#xA;  @Override public int getApi() { return com.android.tools.lint.detector.api.ApiKt.CURRENT_API; }&#xA;&#xA;If you are just using lint checks from a third party library you have no control over, you can disable these lint checks (if they misbehave) like this:&#xA;&#xA;    android {&#xA;        lintOptions {&#xA;            disable &quot;UnsafeExperimentalUsageError&quot;,&#xA;                    &quot;UnsafeExperimentalUsageWarning&quot;&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;"

        summary="Obsolete custom lint check"
        explanation="Lint can be extended with &quot;custom checks&quot;: additional checks implemented by developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages required by a library or a company coding style guideline.&#xA;&#xA;The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.&#xA;&#xA;This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.&#xA;&#xA;It may also flag issues found to be using a **newer** version of the API, meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks."

        severity="Warning"
        message="Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Target SDK attribute is not targeting latest version"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html as well as follow this guide:&#xA;https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk.html"
